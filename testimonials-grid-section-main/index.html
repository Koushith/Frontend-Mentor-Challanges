    <!-- Daniel Clifford Verified Graduate I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
    more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. “


    ”  Verified Graduate   ” Jeanette Harmon
    Verified Graduate An overall wonderful and rewarding experience “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have
    a job I really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ” Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate
    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
    their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
    community of smart and amazing people. ” Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly
    recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
    were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
    referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ” -->

          I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
          heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup.
